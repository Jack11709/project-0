The project is a turn based racing game that can be played by 1 or 2 players. To win the game a player must race their character across the screen and reach the finish line before the other player. This is achieved through a series of moves a player can make each turn, and special abilities that can only be used once per race.

The project was built using:
* HTML
* SCSS
* Javascript ES6
* jQuery
* gulp-babel
* NPM
* Git & GitHub
* herokuapp


Challenges faced during the building of the project generally came from adding the 1 player version of the game and building the AI opponent, making sure it made the decisions that made sense in the context and moment of the game. Constant testing allowed me to fix several bugs with the AI opponent and make overall improvements to my code.

Improvements I would like to make moving forward.

* Overall styling and making separate characters for each player.
* Adding more automation once all player moves have been made.
* Improve the responsive aspects of the design further.
